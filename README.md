Dallas Cowboys Roster data set

This code is intended to provide a roster dataset for the Dallas Cowboys roster 

This data set will keep track of name,  age, height, weight, position, defense/offense


An example of a data-set would be 

'{"name": "Tony Romo", "age": 34, "height": 62, "weight": 230, "postion":"QB"}; 

25 players for the Dallas Cowboys football team will be implemented 

Filter():
    Some of the things  I could filter for in my data set would be different names of players if I wanted to find a certain player in the dataset. I could look for different positions say I wanted to list all the players that are Running Backs. I could look at the players age and look just for the players that are under 30 years old. Same goes for height and weight I could look to see which players are above 6‚Äù0 or under 190lbs

Map(): Everything stated above using map I can use this to map them to their own array. Kind of like having different categories to choose from 

Reduce(): With reduce I could find the average age of all the players in my data set or find the average height and weight.
